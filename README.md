# WT Website (Starter)


## Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start


## Frontend
Open frontend/index.html in a browser (or host it with any static host). The frontend expects the backend at http://localhost:4000 â€” change API_BASE in frontend/app.js if different.




This is a minimal starter. From here you can:
- Add authentication (JWT, sessions).
- Replace JSON file with a proper DB (MongoDB or MySQL).
- Add per-day aggregation, limit one response per user per day.
- Add charts (Chart.js) for nicer visualizations.
